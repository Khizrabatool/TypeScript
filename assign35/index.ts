/*
35. Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to
print out the name of each animal.
• Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as
A dog would make a great pet.
• Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in
common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would
make a great pet!
